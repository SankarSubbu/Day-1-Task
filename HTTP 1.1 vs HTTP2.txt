What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications. 
More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information. 
For instance, when someone navigates to yahoo.com on their laptop, their web browser sends an 
HTTP request to the Cloudflare servers for the content that appears on the page. 
Then, yahoo servers send HTTP responses with the text, images, and formatting that 
the browser displays to the user.


What is HTTP/1.1? 
The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. 
Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. 
This version is still in use on the web.

What is HTTP2?
HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web. 
It was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol, originally developed by Google. 
HTTP/2 was developed by the HTTP Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force.

The key difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2 is that HTTP 2 uses a binary framing layer instead of a text-based layer. This means that HTTP 2 messages are more compact and easier to parse, which can lead to significant performance improvements.

Here is a table summarizing the key differences between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2:

Feature	HTTP 1.1	HTTP 2
Framing	Text-based	Binary
Multiplexing	No	Yes
Header compression	No	Yes
Server push	No	Yes
In addition to the above features, HTTP 2 also includes other features that can improve performance, such as:

Stream prioritization: HTTP 2 allows the client and server to prioritize requests, which can help to improve the loading performance of pages with many resources.
HPACK header compression: HTTP 2 uses a more efficient header compression algorithm than HTTP 1.1, which can further reduce the size of HTTP messages.
Overall, HTTP 2 is a significant improvement over HTTP 1.1 in terms of performance and efficiency. It is now supported by all major browsers and web servers, so it is a good idea to enable HTTP 2 on your website or web application.

Here are some of the benefits of using HTTP 2 over HTTP 1.1:

Faster page loading times
Improved performance for websites and web applications with many resources
Reduced bandwidth usage
Improved security
If you are looking to improve the performance of your website or web application, I recommend enabling HTTP 2.
